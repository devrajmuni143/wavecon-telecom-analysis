# About Wavecon

Wavecon is a leading telecommunications firm that has recently launched its 5G service. The company aims to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of this launch on its key performance indicators (KPIs) and to analyze the performance of its 5G plans over time.

# Objective

The goal is to develop an ad-hoc analysis dashboard to provide insights into the following questions:

- **What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?**
- **Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?**
- **Which plans are performing well in terms of revenue after the 5G launch? Which plans are not performing well?**
- **Are there any plans significantly affected by the 5G launch? Should these plans be continued or discontinued?**
- **Which plans have been discontinued after the 5G launch, and what are the reasons for their discontinuation?**

By answering these questions, we aim to provide actionable insights to help Wavecon make informed decisions about their 5G plans and overall strategy.

# Key Insights

- **Revenue Growth:** Post-5G launch, Wavecon's revenue decreased by 0.5%.
- **Plan Performance:** Plans P1, P2, and P3 have consistently underperformed, with P7 showing particularly weak performance in terms of revenue.
- **New 5G Plans Success:** Plans P11, P12, and P13 performed well, indicating strong adoption and satisfaction among customers.
- **Plan Discontinuation:** Plans 8, 9, and 10 were discontinued, likely due to their underperformance or redundancy with newer offerings.
